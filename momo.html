   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p> What are Momos? Momos are dumplings made with flour and a savory stuffing. This stuffing can be made with veggies, sea-food, chicken or paneer (cottage cheese) .</p>
   <p> Time intensive: Making momos or dim sum takes quite a good amount of time. So when you have enough time to spare, then make them. If you have a helping hand, then the time will reduce. But if you do everything on your own, it takes about 1.5 to 2 hrs, depending on your working speed and the gadgets you have in your kitchen.</p>
  
   <h3> Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour – 125 grams</li>
    <li>2 small-sized spring onions (scallions) finely chopped – reserve the greens to be added later</li>
    <li>1.5 to 1.75 cups finely chopped mix vegetables (I added ½ cup chopped cabbage, ½ cup chopped carrots, ⅓ cup chopped french beans and ¼ cup chopped capsicum)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Make The Dough</p>

           <p>Take 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon oil in a bowl. Mix well with a spoon.</p>
           <p>Add 2 to 3 tablespoon water in parts and begin to knead to a firm dough. Do not make the dough soft as then it becomes difficult to shape the dumplings.</p></li>
    <li> Finely chop the vegetables. You will need 1.5 to 1.75 cups of finely chopped veggies. You can also use a food processor to finely chop vegetables like cabbage, carrots, french beans.</li>
       <li> Heat oil in a thick bottomed frying pan or wok. Add ½ teaspoon finely chopped garlic. Sauté for 2 to 3 seconds on medium-low heat.</li>
